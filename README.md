## What is TUI Writer?

TUI Writer is a terminal-based application that combines real-time
speech transcription with AI-powered editing. Unlike traditional
transcription tools that simply convert speech to text, TUI Writer acts
as an intelligent companion that understands natural language editing
commands.

**Core Workflow:** <br> 1. Speak into your microphone <br> 2. See your
words transcribed in real-time <br> 3. Make edits by speaking naturally:
“change that to…” or “delete the last sentence” <br> 4. The AI
automatically detects and applies your edits <br> 5. Copy the final
transcript to your clipboard <br>

For developers new to `nbdev`, the following sections explain the
development workflow.

### Install TUI Writer in Development Mode

For development and contributions, install the package in editable mode:

``` sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Swiftner/tui_writer.git
cd tui_writer

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Make changes under nbs/ directory
# The notebooks in nbs/ are the source of truth

# After making changes, regenerate the Python modules
nbdev_prepare
```

The `nbdev_prepare` command: - Exports code from notebooks to Python
modules - Runs tests - Updates documentation - Cleans notebook outputs

## Usage

### Installation

### Installation Options

Install TUI Writer using pip:

``` sh
pip install tui_writer
```

Or using uv:

``` sh
uv pip install tui_writer
```

### Prerequisites

TUI Writer requires: <br> - Python 3.9 or higher <br> - A working
microphone <br> - API key for at least one LLM provider (OpenAI,
Anthropic, or Google) <br>

### First Run Setup

After installation, launch the application:

``` sh
tui_writer
```

On first run, you will need to: <br> 1. Press `a` to open AI settings
<br> 2. Select your preferred provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)
<br> 3. Choose a model <br> 4. Enter your API key <br> 5. Press Apply
<br>

The configuration is saved to `~/.config/tui_writer/tui_writer.conf` and
persists across sessions.

### Basic Usage

Once configured: <br> - **Press SPACE** to start recording <br> -
**Speak naturally** - your words appear in real-time <br> - **Say edit
commands** like “change that to…” and they are applied automatically
<br> - **Press SPACE** to stop recording <br> - **Press C** to copy the
transcript to clipboard <br> - **Press Q** to quit <br>

For detailed documentation on all features, press `?` in the application
to view the help screen.

## Using Omarchy Keybindings

Some users may want to use Omarchy to play back previously recorded terminal sessions using tools such as `script` or `asciinema`.

These tools record the text output of your terminal session. Useful for quick debugging, demos, and sharing reproducible steps.

### Example: Record and replay a terminal session

**Record using `script`:**
``` sh
script session.log
# ...run any terminal commands you want recorded...
exit
```

**Replay using `scriptreplay`:**
``` sh
scriptreplay session.log
```

### Binding playback to a key in Omarchy

Add a keybinding in your Omarchy config:
``` toml
[keybindings]
p = "scriptreplay ~/session.log"
```
Press **P** to replay the session.

**Example using `asciinema`**

Record:
``` sh
asciinema rec demo.cast
```

Play back:
``` sh
asciinema play demo.cast
```

These examples can be adapted to your workflow if you use Omarchy alongside TUI Writer.
