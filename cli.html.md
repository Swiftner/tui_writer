# CLI


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The CLI module provides the entry point for launching TUI Writer. Built
with Typer and Rich, it offers a clean command-line interface that
immediately launches the full-featured terminal UI.

**Features:** - Single command to launch the complete TUI experience -
Rich console output for status messages - Simple integration with
standard shell workflows - Typer-based command structure for potential
future command expansion

## Usage

The CLI is designed to be minimal and straightforward. The primary use
case is launching the interactive TUI.

### Launch the TUI (Default)

``` bash
tui_writer
```

This is the recommended way to start TUI Writer. It launches the full
Textual-based interface with all features available: live transcription,
AI editing, settings management, and keyboard shortcuts.

### Advanced Usage

If you need to explicitly call the TUI command:

``` bash
python -m tui_writer.cli tui
```

## Implementation Details

The CLI uses Typer to define a single command application. The main
`tui()` function creates an instance of `TranscriptionTUI` and starts
the Textual application event loop.

The `Console` from Rich is available for any future CLI enhancements
that might need formatted output, though the current implementation
focuses entirely on the TUI experience.
