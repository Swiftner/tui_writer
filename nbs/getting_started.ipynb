    "## What is TUI Writer?\n",
    "\n",
    "TUI Writer is a terminal-based application that combines real-time speech transcription with AI-powered editing. Unlike traditional transcription tools that simply convert speech to text, TUI Writer acts as an intelligent companion that understands natural language editing commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Workflow:** <br>\n",
    "1. Speak into your microphone <br>\n",
    "2. See your words transcribed in real-time <br>\n",
    "3. Make edits by speaking naturally: \"change that to...\" or \"delete the last sentence\" <br>\n",
    "4. The AI automatically detects and applies your edits <br>\n",
    "5. Copy the final transcript to your clipboard <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For developers new to `nbdev`, the following sections explain the development workflow."
