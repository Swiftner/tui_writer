    "- Single command to launch the complete TUI experience\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI is designed to be minimal and straightforward. The primary use case is launching the interactive TUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch the TUI (Default)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "tui_writer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the recommended way to start TUI Writer. It launches the full Textual-based interface with all features available: live transcription, AI editing, settings management, and keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to explicitly call the TUI command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m tui_writer.cli tui\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI uses Typer to define a single command application. The main `tui()` function creates an instance of `TranscriptionTUI` and starts the Textual application event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Console` from Rich is available for any future CLI enhancements that might need formatted output, though the current implementation focuses entirely on the TUI experience."
