    "This module implements a real-time speech-to-text system that: <br>\n",
    "- Listens to microphone input continuously <br>\n",
    "- Uses **Silero VAD** (Voice Activity Detection) to detect when you are speaking <br>\n",
    "- Automatically segments audio into utterances based on natural pauses <br>\n",
    "- Transcribes each utterance using **Faster-Whisper** (optimized Whisper implementation) <br>\n",
    "- Streams transcribed text chunks as they become available <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **PyAudio Thread**: Captures raw audio from the microphone <br>\n",
    "2. **AsyncIO Queue**: Thread-safe bridge between audio callback and async processing <br>\n",

    "4. **Worker Threads**: Runs Whisper transcription without blocking the main loop <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This design ensures audio capture never blocks or drops frames while maintaining responsive transcription."

    "## Silero VAD - Voice Activity Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The `load_silero_vad()` function loads the **Silero VAD** model from PyTorch Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is VAD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Voice Activity Detection is a technique for identifying segments of audio that contain human speech. Silero VAD is a lightweight neural network that outputs a probability score (0.0 to 1.0) indicating the likelihood that a given audio chunk contains speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why VAD Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Without VAD, a transcription system would: <br>\n",
    "- Send every audio chunk to Whisper (expensive and slow) <br>\n",
    "- Transcribe silence and background noise <br>\n",
    "- Have difficulty segmenting continuous speech into utterances <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With VAD, the system: <br>\n",
    "- Only transcribes when speech is detected <br>\n",
    "- Automatically segments based on natural pauses <br>\n",
    "- Reduces API costs and improves responsiveness <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The Silero VAD model: <br>\n",
    "- Accepts 16 kHz audio tensors <br>\n",
    "- Returns a single float between 0.0 and 1.0 <br>\n",
    "- Runs extremely fast (< 1ms per chunk on CPU) <br>\n",
    "- Requires no internet connection after initial download <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If loading fails (offline, network issues), the function returns `None` and the transcriber raises a runtime error since VAD is essential for operation."

    "## LiveTranscriber Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LiveTranscriber` class captures live audio from your microphone, detects when you are speaking using **Silero VAD**, and transcribes each spoken sentence using **Faster-Whisper** once you pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "It runs asynchronously, making it ideal for real-time interfaces like TUIs or voice assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **model_id** (`str`): Whisper model to use <br>\n",
    "  - Options: `\"tiny\"`, `\"base\"`, `\"small\"`, `\"medium\"`, `\"large-v3\"` <br>\n",
    "  - Trade-off: Speed vs. accuracy (tiny is fastest, large is most accurate) <br>\n",
    "  - Default: `\"openai/whisper-base\"` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **language** (`str`): ISO language code for transcription <br>\n",
    "  - Default: `\"en\"` (English) <br>\n",
    "  - Supports 40+ languages (see Whisper documentation) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **force_cpu** (`bool`): Force CPU usage even if GPU is available <br>\n",
    "  - Useful for systems where GPU is reserved for other tasks <br>\n",
    "  - Default: `False` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **on_transcript** (`Callable`): Callback function called with each transcribed text chunk <br>\n",
    "  - Signature: `def callback(text: str) -> None` or `async def callback(text: str) -> None` <br>\n",
    "  - Called once per utterance (speech segment followed by silence) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **vad_threshold** (`float`): Silero confidence threshold (0.0–1.0) <br>\n",
    "  - Higher values require more confident speech detection <br>\n",
    "  - Lower values are more sensitive but may catch background noise <br>\n",
    "  - Default: `0.5` (balanced) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_speech_duration_ms** (`int`): Minimum length of speech to count as valid <br>\n",
    "  - Filters out very brief sounds that might be noise <br>\n",
    "  - Default: `250` ms <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_silence_duration_ms** (`int`): How long silence must last before triggering transcription <br>\n",
    "  - Controls utterance segmentation <br>\n",
    "  - Lower values create more frequent, shorter transcriptions <br>\n",
    "  - Higher values wait longer before processing <br>\n",
    "  - Default: `500` ms <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### start() - Begin Transcription\n",
    "Starts the microphone capture and transcription loop. Runs asynchronously until `stop()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "await transcriber.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### stop(transcribe_remaining=True) - Stop Transcription\n",
    "Gracefully stops audio processing. If `transcribe_remaining=True`, processes any buffered speech before exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "await transcriber.stop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### process_audio() - Internal Processing Loop\n",
    "Continuously consumes audio chunks from the queue, runs VAD, and triggers transcription. Automatically called by `start()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _transcribe_chunk(audio_data) - Transcription\n",
    "Uses Whisper to transcribe one complete utterance. Runs in a worker thread to avoid blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _detect_speech_silero(audio_chunk) - VAD Analysis\n",
    "Returns `True` if Silero VAD detects speech in the current chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Audio Capture**: PyAudio streams 512-sample chunks (32 ms at 16 kHz) from the microphone <br>\n",
    "2. **Thread Safety**: Audio callback pushes chunks to an AsyncIO queue via `call_soon_threadsafe` <br>\n",
    "3. **VAD Processing**: Each chunk is analyzed by Silero VAD <br>\n",
    "4. **Speech Buffering**: Speech chunks are accumulated in a list <br>\n",
    "5. **Silence Detection**: When silence persists for `min_silence_duration_ms`, buffered speech is sent to Whisper <br>\n",
    "6. **Transcription**: Whisper runs in a worker thread and calls `on_transcript` with the result <br>\n",
    "7. **State Reset**: Buffer is cleared and the system is ready for the next utterance <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "IDLE (waiting for speech)\n",
    "  ↓ (speech detected)\n",
    "RECORDING (buffering speech chunks)\n",
    "  ↓ (silence detected for min_silence_duration_ms)\n",
    "TRANSCRIBING (Whisper processes buffered audio)\n",
    "  ↓ (transcription complete)\n",
    "IDLE (ready for next utterance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation carefully manages threading: <br>\n",
    "- **PyAudio thread**: Runs the audio callback <br>\n",
    "- **AsyncIO thread**: Runs the processing loop <br>\n",
    "- **Worker threads**: Run Whisper transcription <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication between threads uses `asyncio.Queue` and `loop.call_soon_threadsafe()` to ensure thread safety."
