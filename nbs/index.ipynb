    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "TUI Writer is an AI-assisted transcription tool that brings speech-to-text capabilities directly to your terminal. Unlike traditional transcription tools that simply convert audio to text, TUI Writer is designed as a collaborative companion that engages in dialogue with you, helping to refine and improve your text iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built with a modern Python stack using [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) for the terminal interface and [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) for high-quality transcription, TUI Writer offers a streamlined workflow for anyone who wants to write through speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Real-Time Transcription**: Live audio recording and transcription with visual feedback\n",
    "-  **Voice Activity Detection**: Intelligent speech detection using Silero VAD with configurable thresholds\n",
    "-  **AI-Powered Editing**: Natural language commands to refine and edit transcripts using LLM integration\n",
    "-  **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models via lisette\n",
    "-  **Interactive TUI**: Clean, keyboard-driven interface built with Textual\n",
    "-  **Configurable Audio Settings**: Adjustable VAD threshold, speech/silence duration settings\n",
    "-  **Clipboard Integration**: Instantly copy transcriptions to your clipboard\n",
    "-  **XDG-Compliant Configuration**: Secure API key storage and persistent user preferences"

    "## Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install TUI Writer using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tui_writer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or using uv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv pip install tui_writer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed installation instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch the TUI interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "tui_writer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the TUI is running, use these keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`spacebar`** - Start/stop recording\n",
    "- **`a`** - AI settings (configure provider and model)\n",
    "- **`s`** - Audio settings (VAD threshold, speech/silence duration)\n",
    "- **`c`** - Copy transcription to clipboard\n",
    "- **`?`** - Help screen with all shortcuts\n",
    "- **`q`** - Quit the application"

    "## Example Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a typical workflow with TUI Writer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Launch the app**: Run `tui_writer` in your terminal\n",
    "2. **Configure AI** (first time): Press `a` to set up your AI provider and API key\n",
    "3. **Start recording**: Press `spacebar` to begin transcribing\n",
    "4. **Speak naturally**: Talk into your microphone - your words appear in real-time\n",
    "5. **AI Editing**: Simply speak edit commands like \"change that to...\" or \"replace the last sentence with...\" - the AI automatically detects and applies edits\n",
    "6. **Stop recording**: Press `spacebar` again when you're done speaking\n",
    "7. **Copy & use**: Press `c` to copy the transcription to your clipboard\n",
    "\n",
    "The transcription appears in the text area with AI-powered edit detection working automatically in the background."
