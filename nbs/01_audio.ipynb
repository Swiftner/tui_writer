    "The AudioRecorder class encapsulates all functionality related to capturing audio input from the user's microphone. This component is responsible for the critical first step in our transcription pipeline: converting analog audio signals into digital data that can be processed by machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio recording system is designed with several key principles in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides immediate visual feedback during recording\n",
    "3. **Resource Management**: Properly manages audio streams and file handles\n",
    "4. **Error Resilience**: Handles device failures and audio issues gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audio Processing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Microphone Input → Audio Stream → Digital Conversion → WAV File → Model Input\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The recording process involves several technical transformations that happen transparently to the user."

    "\n",
    "The `AudioRecorder` class implements a comprehensive audio capture system that handles the entire pipeline from microphone input to digital file storage. This section explores the key components and demonstrates usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The recorder can be configured for different audio quality requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# High-quality stereo recording\n",
    "recorder = AudioRecorder(sample_rate=44100, channels=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standard mono recording (default)\n",
    "recorder = AudioRecorder()  # 16kHz, mono\n",
    "\n",
    "# Low-bandwidth recording for efficiency\n",
    "recorder = AudioRecorder(sample_rate=8000, channels=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross-Platform File Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The system automatically handles file storage across different operating systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Automatic path resolution based on platform\n",
    "recorder = AudioRecorder()\n",
    "print(recorder.audio_file_path)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Windows: C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\hns\\Cache\\last_recording.wav\n",
    "# macOS: ~/Library/Caches/hns/last_recording.wav\n",
    "# Linux: ~/.cache/hns/last_recording.wav\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The system includes robust error handling for various failure scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastcore.test import test_fail\n",
    "\n",
    "recorder = AudioRecorder()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test device validation\n",

    "# Test recording validation\n",
    "test_fail(lambda: recorder.stop_recording(), contains=\"No audio recorded\")\n",
    "```\n",
