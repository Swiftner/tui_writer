# Welcome to TUI Writer


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Overview

TUI Writer is an AI-assisted transcription tool that brings
speech-to-text capabilities directly to your terminal. Unlike
traditional transcription tools that simply convert audio to text, TUI
Writer is designed as a collaborative companion that engages in dialogue
with you, helping to refine and improve your text iteratively.

Built with a modern Python stack using
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) for the terminal interface and
[Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) for
high-quality transcription, TUI Writer offers a streamlined workflow for
anyone who wants to write through speech.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Transcription**: Live audio recording and transcription
  with visual feedback
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Intelligent speech detection using
  Silero VAD with configurable thresholds
- **AI-Powered Editing**: Natural language commands to refine and edit
  transcripts using LLM integration
- **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and
  Google models via lisette
- **Interactive TUI**: Clean, keyboard-driven interface built with
  Textual
- **Configurable Audio Settings**: Adjustable VAD threshold,
  speech/silence duration settings
- **Clipboard Integration**: Instantly copy transcriptions to your
  clipboard
- **XDG-Compliant Configuration**: Secure API key storage and persistent
  user preferences

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install TUI Writer using pip:

``` bash
pip install tui_writer
```

Or using uv:

``` bash
uv pip install tui_writer
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Getting Started
Guide](getting_started.html).

### Basic Usage

Launch the TUI interface:

``` bash
tui_writer
```

Once the TUI is running, use these keyboard shortcuts:

- **`spacebar`** - Start/stop recording
- **`a`** - AI settings (configure provider and model)
- **`s`** - Audio settings (VAD threshold, speech/silence duration)
- **`c`** - Copy transcription to clipboard
- **`?`** - Help screen with all shortcuts
- **`q`** - Quit the application

## Example Workflow

Here’s a typical workflow with TUI Writer:

1.  **Launch the app**: Run `tui_writer` in your terminal
2.  **Configure AI** (first time): Press `a` to set up your AI provider
    and API key
3.  **Start recording**: Press `spacebar` to begin transcribing
4.  **Speak naturally**: Talk into your microphone - your words appear
    in real-time
5.  **AI Editing**: Simply speak edit commands like “change that to…” or
    “replace the last sentence with…” - the AI automatically detects and
    applies edits
6.  **Stop recording**: Press `spacebar` again when you’re done speaking
7.  **Copy & use**: Press `c` to copy the transcription to your
    clipboard

The transcription appears in the text area with AI-powered edit
detection working automatically in the background.
