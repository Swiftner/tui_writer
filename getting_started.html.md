## What is TUI Writer?

TUI Writer is a terminal-based application that combines real-time
speech transcription with AI-powered editing. Unlike traditional
transcription tools that simply convert speech to text, TUI Writer acts
as an intelligent companion that understands natural language editing
commands.

**Core Workflow:** <br> 1. Speak into your microphone <br> 2. See your
words transcribed in real-time <br> 3. Make edits by speaking naturally:
“change that to…” or “delete the last sentence” <br> 4. The AI
automatically detects and applies your edits <br> 5. Copy the final
transcript to your clipboard <br>

For developers new to `nbdev`, the following sections explain the
development workflow.

### Install TUI Writer in Development Mode

For development and contributions, install the package in editable mode:

``` sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Swiftner/tui_writer.git
cd tui_writer

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Make changes under nbs/ directory
# The notebooks in nbs/ are the source of truth

# After making changes, regenerate the Python modules
nbdev_prepare
```

The `nbdev_prepare` command: - Exports code from notebooks to Python
modules - Runs tests - Updates documentation - Cleans notebook outputs
